Notes for alyssa:
1. fix up the objects (pigs + wolf) at the very end
1. this readme should be instructions for how to read the book; help for parents/teachers and kids

# For Kids

When I was little, I loved writing stories. The power of creation was at my fingertips as I typed away on the big, chunky computer my parents had gotten me. When became a grownup, I learned that coding _was_ for girls, and that started me on a path to become a Software Engineer (or, a Web Developer). I was surprised to find that coding wasn't boring! In fact, it reminded me a lot of the stories I used to write, for a few reasons:
  * You "read" and "write" code, and it turned out that it could tell a story
  * It reminded me of the worlds I would create, only now, I could do it for real.


# For Grownups

<!-- not sure about below paragraph -->
I wrote to the kids first, not because this story is more for them than ourselves, but because their egos are still so raw and new and a "book" like this is so intimidating. As adults, we (hopefully) have learned the value of expedited learning, which is the goal of this book. As STEM charges our society closer to the future, we as parents and teachers want to teach our children the languages of STEM; how do we do that if we don't know it ourselves?

`TheStoryOfTheThreeLittlePigs` provides a fun and interesting way to passively learn coding in JavaScript. Neither kids nor adults need to be overwhelmed by the rules, syntax (visuals), and lingo of a programming language to be able to understand it.

That being said, it's not like you can read this like any other book.

## How to read it

At the bottom of nearly every page, I've tried to "print" out text (`console.log()`) in a way that makes the book one whole cohesive story. However, when developers are describing code to each other (and we do "read" code to each other often) we often describe, step by step, what each of the lines of code represents in our own words. So I give you full permission to skip my words unless they service you! The code won't change, but the story tell will, and that is part of the beautify of it.

### Is the story authentic?

While I can't say about the habits of wolves and pigs, I can say that each `page.js` has been run to ensure no errors. It's written in ES6 JavaScript and run with `node`. JavaScript is primarily used on websites. JavaScript doesn't specifically represent the physical things on the screen that you see (HTML), or the colors, fonts, and effects (CSS). JavaScript instead makes HTML and CSS dynamic and interesting. It takes data and figures out how to manipulate it and run it and make things happen. There are many programming languages do the same thing; JavaScript is just what I know best.

If you want to learn more about what all the pieces do and how they work, there are many resources for learning JavaScript and other programming languages, and you can find them at almost any library under Dewey Decimal System 004-006. I personally like JavaScript for Kids, as it was my (adult) introduction to coding.
